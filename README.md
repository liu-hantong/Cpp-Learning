# Cpp-Notes

* Here are some _notes_ and small _practices_ that I wrote while I'm learning **C++**. Some little _console projects_ are also included.

## Projects
* [Game 2048](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/Projects/2048.cpp).
* [Inventory Admin System](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/Projects/InvenAdminSystem).
## Notes
* [Chapter 6](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter6.cpp) 
* [Chapter 7](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter7.cpp)    Practice:[Algorithms.cpp](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/Algorithms.cpp)
* [Chapter 9](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter9.cpp)
* [Chapter 10](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter10.cpp)
* [Chapter 12](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter12/Chapter12.cpp)
* [Chapter 13](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/Primer-Notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter13/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter13.cpp) [13.4-Example.cpp](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/Primer-Notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter13/13.4-Example.cpp)
* [Chapter 14](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter14.cpp)
* [Chapter 16](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/blob/master/primer_notes/C%2B%2BprimerNoteChapter16.cpp)

## Practices
* [A Complex operation implementation](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/OverloadComplex). The basic function, add, subtract, multiply, divide have been implemented. 
* [A C++ class to solve a quadratic equation with one unknown](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/QuadraticEquation). Didn't take the situation when 'a' equals zero into account. The class defination and interface are in the .h file. the implementation is in .cpp file.
* [A STL list container implemantation](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/STL_List_Implementation). The basic function, erase and insert are implemented. The related iterator, _List_iterator is implemented, the operator ++, --, *, and ==, != are reloaded, too.
* [A set class](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/SetClass), many opearations are been reloaded to solve union, intersection, subset and so on.
* [A linked-list implementation stack](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/Stack)  written by C++. push/pop/stackTop/isEmpty/show functions have been realized.
* [A template Iterator class that suits all data types](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/TemplateIterator). The basic operators, +, -, ++, --, =, !=, ==, * are all implemented.
* [A merge sort function using template](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/TemplateMergesort) in C++ which is useful for all datatypes.
* [A merge sort function using template](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/TemplateMergesort) in C++ which is useful for all datatypes.
* [A template class of Queue](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/TemplateQueue) created by C++. The basic functions, pop(), push(), back(), front(), back(), isEmpty(), show() have been implemented.
* [A C++ class of two-dimentional coordinates of x and y](https://github.com/llht/Cpp-Notes/tree/master/practice/Two_dimentional_coordinates). Calculating the distances of two different objects.
