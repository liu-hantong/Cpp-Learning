1. Some notes when reading C++ primer
2. a few practices about oop.

I'd like to share some of my thoughts and origin notes when reading C++ primer.
Any advice or questions are welcome.

The inventory also contains some practices when I learn to program using object oriented method.
Some practices are from a course named advanced programming offered by ICS, Nanjing University.
Thanks for the hard-working professors and assistants.
